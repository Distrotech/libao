It currently\r\nsupports:\r\n   * Null output\r\n   * WAV files\r\n   * OSS (Open Sound System)\r\n   * ESD (ESounD or Enlightened Sound Daemon)\r\n   * ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture)\r\n   * PulseAudio (next generation GNOME sound server)\r\n   * AIX\r\n   * Solaris (untested)\r\n   * IRIX (untested)\r\n\r\nHISTORY\r\n\r\nLibao began life as cross-platform audio library inside of ac3dec, an\r\nAC3 decoder by Aaron Holtzman that is part of the LiViD project.  When\r\nogg123 (part of the command line vorbis tools) needed a way to play\r\naudio on multiple operating systems, someone on the vorbis-dev mailing\r\nlist suggested the libao library as a possible way to add cross-platform \r\nsupport to ogg123. Stan Seibert downloaded the libao library, severely \r\nhacked it up in order to make the build process simpler and support \r\nmultiple live-playback devices. (The original code allowed one live \r\nplayback driver, the wav driver, and a null driver to be compiled into \r\nthe library.) Jack Moffitt got it supporting dynamically loaded plugins \r\nso that binary versions of libao could be provided. The API was revised \r\nfor version 0.8.0.\r\n\r\nThis code is being maintained by Stan Seibert (volsung@xiph.org) \r\nand various other individuals.  Please DO NOT annoy Aaron Holtzman about \r\nbugs, features, comments, etc. regarding this code.\r\n\r\nWORKAROUNDS\r\n\r\nThe OSS emulation in ALSA deviates from the OSS spec by not returning\r\nimmediately from an open() call if the OSS device is already in use.\r\nInstead, it makes the application wait until the device is available.\r\nThis is not desirable during the autodetection phase of libao, so a\r\nworkaround has been included in the source.  Since the workaround\r\nitself violates the OSS spec and causes other problems on some\r\nplatforms, it is only enabled when ALSA is detected.  The workaround\r\ncan be turned on or off by passing the --enable-broken-oss or\r\n--disable-broken-oss flag to the configure script.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

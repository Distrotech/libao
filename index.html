<hr><p>OVERVIEW</p>

<p>Libao is a cross-platform audio library that allows programs to output
audio using a simple API on a wide variety of platforms.  It currently
supports:</p>

<ul>
<li>Null output</li>
<li>WAV files</li>
<li>OSS (Open Sound System)</li>
<li>ESD (ESounD or Enlightened Sound Daemon)</li>
<li>ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture)</li>
<li>PulseAudio (next generation GNOME sound server)</li>
<li>AIX</li>
<li>Solaris (untested)</li>
<li>IRIX (untested)</li>
</ul><p>HISTORY</p>

<p>Libao began life as cross-platform audio library inside of ac3dec, an
AC3 decoder by Aaron Holtzman that is part of the LiViD project.  When
ogg123 (part of the command line vorbis tools) needed a way to play
audio on multiple operating systems, someone on the vorbis-dev mailing
list suggested the libao library as a possible way to add cross-platform 
support to ogg123. Stan Seibert downloaded the libao library, severely 
hacked it up in order to make the build process simpler and support 
multiple live-playback devices. (The original code allowed one live 
playback driver, the wav driver, and a null driver to be compiled into 
the library.) Jack Moffitt got it supporting dynamically loaded plugins 
so that binary versions of libao could be provided. The API was revised 
for version 0.8.0.</p>

<p>This code is being maintained by Stan Seibert (<a href="mailto:volsung@xiph.org">volsung@xiph.org</a>) 
and various other individuals.  Please DO NOT annoy Aaron Holtzman about 
bugs, features, comments, etc. regarding this code.</p>

<p>WORKAROUNDS</p>

<p>The OSS emulation in ALSA deviates from the OSS spec by not returning
immediately from an open() call if the OSS device is already in use.
Instead, it makes the application wait until the device is available.
This is not desirable during the autodetection phase of libao, so a
workaround has been included in the source.  Since the workaround
itself violates the OSS spec and causes other problems on some
platforms, it is only enabled when ALSA is detected.  The workaround
can be turned on or off by passing the --enable-broken-oss or
--disable-broken-oss flag to the configure script.</p>
